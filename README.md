# BashScripts

## Aim
The repo aims at having shell scripts that ease a normal user's life, or add enhancements. These scripts act as multiple components adding towards the same goal.

## Add your bash scripts that you believe can make life easy. 
### For example: 

* It can be a script that allows one to update/upgrade his distro in just one command

* A script that simplifies the installation of tools/packages for someone who is newbie

* A script that changes the shell theme/icon theme/font on each reboot of the system (that would give a fresh look after every reboot)

* A script that checks the health of system and reports in terminal (using ascii art/or any other method [you may use all that is available to you, to make good things look more beautiful]) that is appealing

* There can be endless things, I believe you could've got an idea of what this repo is for. So, I invite you to contribute to this repo, and show off your scripting powers.
